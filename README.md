# What is boot11strap?
boot11strap is an exploit found by Kingy which allows full access to the 3DS, even with virtualised hardware that is greater than the 3DS, which allows emulation of newer devices and modern PC games!

# Why remake?
Now that I have managed to learn more about the exploit, I am able to develop an even more stable version. This will also allow for greater support and compatability.

# Release when?
The source will be coming before the binaries do, although I do not know when I will release any part of boot11strap. I am going to start the project tomorrow, so it may come tomorrow, or the day after.

Happy hacking!
