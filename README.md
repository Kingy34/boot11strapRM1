# boot11strapRM1
A remake of boot11strap, now able to emulate Switch!

# What is boot11strap?
boot11strap is an exploit found by Kingy which allows full access to the 3DS, even with virtualised hardware that is greater than the 3DS, which allows emulation of newer devices and modern PC games!

# Why remake?
Now that I have managed to learn more about the exploit, I am able to develop an even more stable version. This will also allow for greater support and compatability.

# Release when?
Binaries will come once the project is fully useable, but for now, the source is here and is build-able. Check the Makefile for the dependancies.

Happy hacking!
